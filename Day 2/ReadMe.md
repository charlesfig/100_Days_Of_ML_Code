## Day 2: 13th July, 2018
**Today's Progress** : Set up [Trello](www.trello.com) board for organization + Speed Dial 2 extension for Google Chrome to keep track of resources. 
Used [these projects for beginners](https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-projects-for-beginners) as guidance to start. Downloaded [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), numpy and pytest. Also downloaded Jupyter and checked out the notebook through my localhost.
Started with the Sci-Kit Learn [tutorials](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/). Worked on a digit classifier importing datasets from sklearn and using them to classify digits [per their instructions](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#machine-learning-the-problem-setting).

**Comments** : 
I had a lot of trouble with pip for downloading through Terminal. In the end I downloaded Anaconda and used conda instead of pip. 

**Link of Work:** : [digits.py](https://github.com/charlesfig/100_Days_Of_ML_Code/blob/master/Day%202/digits.py)
