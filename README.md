**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed chosing the projects I will work on .

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way .

## Day 1 : Jul 1 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have completed data preparation for kaggle ml problem .

**Thoughts** : It is really challenging and many error occured , but I have debuged them . It was really fun .

## Day 15 : Jul 15 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : continued with SVM , started with SVM kernel.

**Thoughts** : Kernel trick is really a tricky concept . Have to read more of it . And again math is very much important for ML.
