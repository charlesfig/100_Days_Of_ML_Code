# 100_Days_Of_ML_Code

## Day 1 : 12th July, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Thunderbolt-HDMI cable arrived. Did a factory reset on a Mac Mini I had lying around which I will use mainly for this project. Installed software: RStudio, Atom, Pycharm, Sublime Text, Brackets. Followed Corey Schafer [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) to install and setup python.


## Day 2: 13th July, 2018
**Today's Progress** : Set up a [Trello](www.trello.com) board for organization + Speed Dial 2 extension for Google Chrome to keep track of resources. 
Used [these projects for beginners](https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-projects-for-beginners) as guidance to start.
Tried to dowloaded [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), numpy and pytest but had a lot of trouble with pip. In the end I downloaded Anaconda and used conda instead of pip. Also downloaded Jupyter after watching a video of Siraj Raval. I checked out the Jupyter notebook through my localhost.
Started with the Sci-Kit Learn [tutorials](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/). Worked on a digit classifier importing datasets from sklearn and using them to classify digits [per their instructions](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#machine-learning-the-problem-setting).

**Link of Work:** 'upload code' digits.py

## Day 3: 14th July, 2018
**Today's Progress** : Got distracted with Brilliant.org and their Math for Quatitative Finance course. Learned about Markov Chains, which is a nice mix of Discrete Math, Probability and Linear Algebra.

## Day 4: 15th July, 2018
**Today's Progress** : Further the digits recognition code by following a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB6IlpqHy-o). I tweaked the digits.py code to analyze a handwritten digit I feed through an image. The code has trouble with 8s, 9s and 1s.
